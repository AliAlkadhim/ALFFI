# Simulation-Based Frequentist Inference with Tractable and Intractable Likelihoods


## This repository contains the scripts necessary to reproduce all the data and plots from [arxiv:2306.07769](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07769.pdf). Each directory represents one of the examples presented in the paper. Follow the README in each directory for directions to  

To run the code, you have two options: 1) using `conda` and the `ALFFI_environment.yml` or 2) using the stanard python environment and the `requirements.txt` file.
