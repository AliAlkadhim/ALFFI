# Amortized Simulation-Based Frequentist Inference For Tractable and Intractable Likelihoods


## This repository contains the scripts and data necessary to reproduce all the data and plots from the paper **Amortized Simulation-Based Frequentist Inference For Tractable and Intractable Likelihoods**

<!--
[arxiv:2306.07769](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07769.pdf
-->
Each directory represents one of the examples presented in the paper.  

### To install the necessary dependencies to the code, you have two options: 
1) using `conda` and the `ALFFI_env.yml`

```
conda env create -n ALFFI -f ALFFI_env.yml && conda activate ALFFI
```

2) Or, using the stanard python environment (`pip`) and the `requirements.txt` file.

```
pip install -r requirements
```
